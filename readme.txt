This is crucial because it will provide you with a great experience and really good results in the long term.

It will surely be worth it, since hiding the common paths will make hacking a lot harder as well.

If you don't protect yourself, sooner or later you will end up having a hacked website.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Does this plugin work on WP Multisite? =

Yes, the plugin works on WP Multisite and you will configure it for the entire network.

The plugin also works with Apache, Nginx, IIS and LiteSpeed servers

= I forgot the custom login and admin URLs. What now? =

Don't panic.

You can still access your site with the secure parameter
http://domainname/wp-login.php?hmw_disable=[your_code]

= Locked out of my site!  I set the plugin, and after I logged out I couldn't get back in =

Rename the plugin directory /wp-content/plugins/hide-my-wp so that the plugins won't hide the wp-login.php path anymore

Login using http://domainname/wp-login.php and activate the plugin again.

Make sure you remember the secure parameter and it will be much easier.

= Will this plugin work if I don't have custom permalinks on my site? =

No. You need to have custom permalinks set to 'on' in Settings > Permalinks.

You will get a notification in the Settings page if something is not setup right.


= What do I need to do before I deactivate the plugin? =

It's better to switch to Default Mode in Settings > Hide my wp.

If you don't, the plugin will automatically change your site back to the safe URLs and it will tell you what to do if you don't have write permission for the config files

_______________________________________________________________________

= Is this Plugin free of charge? =

Yes. The Lite features of Hide My WP plugin will always be free.

We will include all the required WordPress Security updates.

To unlock all the features, please visit: <a href="https://wpplugins.tips/wordpress">https://wpplugins.tips/wordpress</a>


= Is this plugin enough to protect my website from all hackers? =

The Free version of Hide My WP hides the wp-admin and wp-login as described but will not protect you from all hacker attacks.


Hide My WP Ghost hides all the common paths and patterns used but bots to detect that you are using WordPress.

We also recommend you to install Premium Themes and Plugins and not just any WordPress plugin because the free plugins are usually made by beginners and they don't have security knowledge.
